[TAG] module: describe your change in a short sentence (ideally < 50 chars)

Long version of the change description, including the rationale for the change,
or a summary of the feature being introduced.

Please spend a lot more time describing WHY the change is being done rather
than WHAT is being changed. This is usually easy to grasp by actually reading
the diff. WHAT should be explained only if there are technical choices
or decision involved. In that case explain WHY this decision was taken.

End the message with references, such as task or bug numbers, PR numbers, and
OPW tickets, following the suggested format:

Fixes #123  (close related issue on Github)
Closes #123  (close related PR on Github)
