# Exercise

# Add a stat button to property type.

# Add the field property_type_id to estate_property_offer. We can define it as a related field on property_id.property_type_id and set it as stored.

# Thanks to this field, an offer will be linked to a property type when itâ€™s created. You can add the field to the list view of offers to make sure it works.

# Add the field offer_ids to estate.property.type which is the One2many inverse of the field defined in the previous step.

# Add the field offer_count to estate.property.type. It is a computed field that counts the number of offers for a given property type (use offer_ids to do so).

# At this point, you have all the information necessary to know how many offers are linked to a property type. When in doubt, add offer_ids and offer_count directly to the view. The next step is to display the list when clicking on the stat button.

# Create a stat button on estate.property.type pointing to the estate_property_offer action. This means you should use the type="action" attribute (go back to the end of Chapter 9: Ready For Some Action? if you need a refresher).

# At this point, clicking on the stat button should display all offers. We still need to filter out the offers.

# On the estate_property_offer action, add a domain that defines property_type_id as equal to the active_id (= the current record, here is an example)
