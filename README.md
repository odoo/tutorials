# Odoo tutorials

This repository hosts the code for the bases and solutions of the
[official Odoo tutorials](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/tutorials.html).

It has 3 branches for each Odoo version: one for the bases, one for
[Discover the JS framework](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/tutorials/discover_js_framework.html) solutions and one for [Master the Odoo web framework](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/tutorials/master_odoo_web_framework.html) solutions. For example, `17.0`, `17.0-discover-js-framework-solutions` and `17.0-master-odoo-web-framework-solutions`. 
The first contains the code of the modules that serve as base for the tutorials,
and the others contains the code of each chapter with the complete
solution.
